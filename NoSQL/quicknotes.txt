What is NoSQL?

Different type of storage than traditional tabular relations used in RDBMS

It means not only sql, non relational sql.

Simplified design, horizontal scaling and finer control. 

Increasingly popular with "big data" and real-time web applications, companies like google or twitter have moved to this.

Advantages---

Big data, hold more, no explicit schema or table structure(having to plan out tables and relationships), allows us to create

collections on the fly, scale out architecture, less expensive and less management, not having to pay admins to manage the database.

Disadvantages---

Maturity, relatively new, support & community still in development, not many people with nosql experience. Ad hoc query and analysis, so tools 

don't provide connections to nosql databases. 

Horizontal Scaling (Out/In) adding more nodes to a system, one web server to three, adding more computer to a distributed sytem. 

Hundreds of small computers can be configured in a "cluster" into one massive powerful unit.

Vertical Scaling--- 

Relational databases tend to do this:

Adding high end resources to a single node in the system, resources may include CPU, memory, drives, etc.

Uses virtualization technology more efficiently.

Typically horizontal scaling is better and less expensive.


Types of NoSQL databases:

Column: Cassandra, Hbase, Vertica

Document: MongoDB, CouchDb, Rethink

Key/Value: Couchbase, Dynamo, Memcached, Redis

Graph: Neo4J, MarkLogic

Column Database----

A column of a distributed data store is a NoSQL object of the lowest level in a keyspace. It is a tuple (a key-value pair) 

consisting of three elements: Unique name, value, and a timestamp

Key/ Value store

Data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, more commonly known today as a 

dictionary or hash. Value can have multiple sub values.


Graph Database---

Database tha uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. Key 

concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship), which directly relates data items in the store.

Document Database---

Designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document oriented information, also known as semi-structured data. Data is 

stored in JSON-like documents. 

BSON is a binary representation of JSON.

MongoDB uses a combination of the GNU AGPL and Apache license.

Schema less, structure of a single object is clear. No complex joins, deeper query ability. Easy to scale out.

Documents are rows and collections are tables in MongoDB

See data types that documents can hold.

commands:

use projectmanagement to get into a db or create one if it does not exist.

db.createCollection('projects'); -- creates a collection/table

db.projects.insert({name: 'Company Website',category: 'Web Design',due_date: new Date('2016-12-12'),technologies: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Javascript'],developers: [{name: 'Jesus Becerra',role: 'Head Programmer'},{name: 'John Doe',role: 'Designer'}],client: {name: 'Steven Smith',email: 'ssmith@gmail.com',phone: '555-555-5555'},cost: 2000});

and then to see what was stored we can use db.projects.find();

Or we can do db.projects.find().pretty(); to make it look nicer.
