CSS is a style sheet language that describes the style of an HTML document
and how HTML elements should be displayed.

CSS can be placed in <style></style> tags or stored in external .css files.

Two main parts are the selector and the declaration. Declaration consists of 
a property and a value.

Four different position values:

static, relative, fixed, and absolute

Static is default, not affected by top, bottom, left, right properties.

Relative, positioned relative to its normal position

position: relative
left: 30px;

Fixed is relative to the viewport, how it looks in the browser window.

Absolute, is positioned relative  to the nearest positioned ancestor.

Flexbox is a flex container, with some flex items inside.
