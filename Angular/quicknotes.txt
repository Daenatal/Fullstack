Angular2, new framework

What is it?

Client side framework for building web applications using JavaScript

Complete framework not a library like Jquery, this is HTML for web applications.

More functionality with less code, used often with single page applications (SPA), dynamically update the page, giving a much more fluid experience

Attributes called directives.

Features & Advantages---

Speed & Performance asynch

Cross Platform, mobile and hybrid, IONIC uses Angular for UI components

Comprehensive Routing

2 Way Data Binding can easily setup, makes UI update when model is updated.

Dynamic Templates

Component Encapsulation(app is divided into components that can be reused)


Building With Components----

Division of responsibilities, reusable code, easier to read, easy for multiple developer collaboration.

Controllers and scope no longer part of angular 2.


Typescript----

A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript

Support for classes

Static checking and code refactoring

Use of decorators, allows us to attach metadata


Example---

@Component({ //decorator is @ and component
    selector: 'mycomponent',
    template: '<h1>Hello World</h1>
})

export class MyComponent {
    constructor() {
        this.name = "John Doe";
    }
}

director must match selector <mycomponent></mycomponent>

Services----

- Used to organize and share code and resources across an applications

- Services are great for things like API's and database access, want code to be in a service so all components can access it.

- Services are lazily instantiated, angular only starts a service when an application component depends on it

- Services are injected through the component class constructor

Routing---

-Interprets a browser URL as an instruction

- Can be passed optional parameters to help decide what content to display

- We can bind the router to links on a page and it will navigate to the appropriate application view when 

the user clicks a link.

Security Best Practices---

- Keep up to date with teh latest library releases.

- Do not modify your copy of angular.

- Avoid APIs marked "Security Risk".

Angular cli we can look at later
