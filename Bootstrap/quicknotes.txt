Grid System-

Bootstrap includes a 12 column responsive, mobile-first fluid grid system which uses pre-defined classes and easy layout options.

Container, row an columns, container pushes everything to the middle, horizontal groups of columns are rows to ensure everything lines up correctly.

So a div stretches out to about 12 columns anything bigger won't work when using the class="col-size-length"
