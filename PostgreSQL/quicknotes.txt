If you try to login with a user, it'll try to log you into a database psql -U devuser for example so we 
need a database the user has been added onto, in our example we had acme.

CREATE USER devuser WITH PASSWORD 'peanut18';

SELECT * FROM pg_user;

ALTER USER devuser WITH SUPERUSER;

GRANT ALL ON database acme TO devuser;

CREATE TABLE articles(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(255), body TEXT); creating a table with the fields, SERIAL meants 

it auto increments.

INSERT INTO articles(title, body) VALUES('Article One', 'This is the body for article one');

ALTER TABLE articles ADD COLUMN category_id INT; adding a column to a table.

ALTER TABLE articles ADD CONSTRAINT catfk FOREIGN KEY(category_id) REFERENCES categories(id);

DELETE FROM articles WHERE id = 3;
